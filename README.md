## Configuration

1. **Access Plugin Settings**  
   After activating the plugin, navigate to **DorineMae Apps** in the WordPress admin menu to access your plugin settings.

2. **Elementor Cache & Sync Feature**  
   - **Enable "Clear Elementor Cache & Sync":**  
     Enable this option to add a **CleanUp Elementor** button to the admin bar.
   - **How It Works:**  
     Clicking the **CleanUp Elementor** button triggers an AJAX process that simulates clearing Elementor‚Äôs cache and syncing its library.
   - **Visual Feedback:**  
     - Spinner buttons update their state sequentially:
       - **Default:** `button elementor-button-spinner`
       - **Loading:** `button elementor-button-spinner loading`
       - **Success:** `button elementor-button-spinner success`
     - A centered popup message‚Äî‚ÄúElementor cache cleared and library synced successfully.‚Äù‚Äîappears in the middle of the screen.
     - Approximately 1 second after the popup disappears, the page automatically refreshes.

3. **Auto-Expire Elementor Sections/Widgets Feature**  
   - **Auto-Expire Functionality is Always Active:**  
     This feature automatically hides Elementor sections or widgets once the specified expiration timestamp is reached.
   - **Setting Expiry Rules:**  
     In the plugin settings, simply enter the CSS class of the target element and set the corresponding date and time for when it should be hidden. Once you click **Save Changes**, the expiry rule becomes active, and the specified elements will automatically be hidden at the scheduled time.

4. **Save Your Settings**  
   After configuring the options above, click **Save Changes** to update your settings.
 

## Usage  

- **Cache Cleanup:** Click the **CleanUp Elementor** button in the admin bar when enabled.
